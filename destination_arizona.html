            <p>The Grand Canyon gets most of the attention, but it&#39;s far from Arizona&#39;s only natural
                wonder to leave you breathless at its beauty. From rust-red cliffs cut through by blue
                ribbons of water, to towering rock formations that defy belief, to a massive living cave
                beneath your feet, Arizona is full of incredible parks and monuments worthy of a visit.</p>
            <p>Vast, magnificent and inarguably beautiful, the Grand Canyon is easily Arizona’s most
                distinguishable landmark—a natural wonder you must see to believe. Stretching 277
                miles from end to end, its rocky walls descend more than a mile to the canyon’s floor, where the wild
                Colorado River traces a swift course southwest.</p>
            <p>Everyone should see the Grand Canyon at least once in their life, and 2019 is a special
                year to visit because Grand Canyon National Park is celebrating its 100th birthday. If
                you’ve never been, this First-Timer’s Guide to the Grand Canyon will help you plan your visit.</p>

            <p>Arizona is composed of cities both rural and metropolitan. Individually, each offers
                charm and a distinct personality. But there’s another layer to explore – communities and
                regions that, combined, have so much more to offer and are a must-visit destination of their own.</p>
            <p>A trail that spans 800 miles of deserts, mountains, canyons and more; a county
                composed of history, from Old West outlaws to an expedition in search of gold; a
                Mother Road dotted with attractions worth pulling over for; a recreational wonderland for
                skiing, fishing, hunting, and camping; and a valley of color – red rocks, green vineyards,
                and blue skies. These are destinations where the sum of parts is truly the whole package.</p>
            <p>Long before the Wild West. Even before the extinction of saber-toothed cats and the
                mammoth. As far back as 12,000 years ago, indigenous cultures made their home in
                what, today, we affectionately call Arizona. These early inhabitants settled into villages
                throughout the diverse regions of Arizona, giving formation to tribes such as the
                Ancestral Puebloans, Hohokam, Mogollon, and Patayan people.</p>

            <p>Today, 22 sovereign American Indian communities reside in Arizona, lending their
                unique spiritual, cultural, and economic richness to the state. Throughout Arizona, you
                can step into the past and experience up-close the artifacts and fascinating structures
                built and used by these tribes at a number of American Indian-operated museums and
                cultural centers.</p>
            <p>For anyone visiting Arizona, the unique American Indian heritage and culture here is a
                must-see for getting a firsthand understanding of our state's special and important
                history.</p>
            <p>The opportunities to visit tribal lands and experience their cultures differ among the
                different American Indian communities. While many tribes, like the Navajo Nation and
                White Mountain Apache, welcome visitors for a more robust experience, others limit
                involvement to their commercial interests.</p>
            <h3>What to know before you go:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Each tribe's land is a sovereign nation with its own government, laws, and rules
                    for visitors.</li>
                <li>Many sacred areas, such as grave sites, are restricted and not open to non-tribal
                    members.</li>
                <li>Alcohol isn't permitted or tolerated on tribal land, except in designated areas like
                    casinos.</li>

                        spans 800 miles, to a county known for its Old West Outlaws, to an infamous highway
                        dotted with kitschy attractions, you’re sure to experience something unforgettable.</p>
